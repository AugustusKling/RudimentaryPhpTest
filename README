RudimentaryPhpTest is a very simple framework for running PHP unit tests.

Tests can be stored in any nested folder or a single file. The framework traverses the folder to find PHP files. If those define classes inheriting from BaseTest they are seen as test classes. All methods matching a filter expression are executed as tests – the default is to execute all methods whose name ends in “Test”.

After the test runs complete a simple table is printed to the console which lists the tests and their assertions.

So far, this framework was developed and tested on PHP 5.3 running on Linux. It should run on any PHP 5 in theory, though.

Invocation is as follows where the parameter testfilter is optional and testbase gives the root file or directory with tests to execute:
php -f RudimentaryPhpTest.php -- --testbase='samples' [ --testfilter='Test$' ]
